								<h2>Context</h2>
								<p>ArcGIS Field Maps is an app that allows Mobile data collection apps by the users of the app. A survey is designed by the data collector, which is sent out through the mobile app. When filling in the survey, every responder’s real-time location is reported, in addition to the survey questions. 
								Finally, each data point appears in a map, which can be edited on Esri Online to create a new map, with all the data points on it, to reveal previously unknown insights.</p>

								
								<h2>Map Description</h2>
								<p>The map we created aimed to collect GIS data on how people felt about certain types of tree in and around the proximity of Utrecht Science Park. Feelings about a tree were expressed on a scale ranging from deeply unsettled to happy.
								The resulting map is displayed here. On this map, each point corresponds to a survey response, and the pop-up shows their name, location, and answer. 
								We wanted to use this map to understand if there were any trends in which tree type made people the happiest. This trend could guide the Utrecht Gementee in their tree-planting, so that it has the most positive impact on the people in its surroundings. 
								Additionally, it could aid decisions on the most suitable trees in parks/the city to place benches under.
								This we hypothesised would require a large enough response rate, for trends to be realised.  Furthermore, it would require overlaying this map with a map containing data-points corresponding to all the different tree types in Utrecht (“Bomenkaart Update 2024”) published part of the Open GEO Consortium (OGC), shown as a second layer in this map.</p>
								 
								<h2>Map Making Process</h2>
								<p>We designed a simple survey for our map on ArcGIS Field Maps software, and shared it with our classmates using the mobile app. 
									The field map was edited on Esri Online to create an interactive map. The final map has 2 layers: The Utrecht Tree Data ("Bomenkaart Update 2024") & the Utrecht Science Park Field Map.</p>
